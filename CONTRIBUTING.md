## I found a bug or vulnerability, how do I report it?

Awesome! Please share your finding with us by [openning a new issue ticket](https://github.com/knowcss/knowcss/issues/new). When you are creating the ticket, tag the ticket with either the "bug" or "vuln" tag then describe in detail what you found. Also, very important, please provide clear instructions on how we can reproduce the bug or vulnerability. A maintainer will review your issue ticket as soon as possible and get back to you with any feedback.  

## I have an idea for a new feature, how do I share it?

If you would like to share an idea for a new feature please [open a new issue ticket](https://github.com/knowcss/knowcss/issues/new) and tag the ticket with the "enhancement" tag.

## I don't want to contribute, I just have a question about how to use KnowCSS.

Cool! You can [open a new issue ticket](https://github.com/knowcss/knowcss/issues/new) and tag it with the "help" tag and ask our community for help. Please keep in mind that people in our community are volunteers, so it may take some time to respond to your question. 

We always recommend that everyone read the KnowCSS documentation first before opening a ticket with a question, as the answer that you are looking for could be in the documentation.
